The details of the movie(title,genre,director,cast) are downloaded from the source Kaggle dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows?resource=download)

## Features
- Filter by genre, director, and cast
- Fuzzy matching to find the closest genre, director, or cast name
- Provides top movie recommendations based on user input

  ## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- FuzzyWuzzy

1. Personalized Recommendations: The system uses fuzzy matching to handle typos and slight variations in user input, ensuring the best possible matches.
2. Multi-Level Filtering: With multiple layers of filtering—by type, genre, and specific attributes—the recommendations are highly targeted and relevant.
3. Open Source and Community-Driven: Contributions from the community are encouraged, making this a living, evolving project.
